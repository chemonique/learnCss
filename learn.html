    <h2>second paragraph</h2>
    <p id="hoof">At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give 
        them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
        structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?),
        and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and 
        introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
